# PARKINSONS DISEASE PREDICTION
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by tremors, stiffness, and difficulty walking. Early detection and diagnosis can significantly improve the quality of life for patients. Machine learning has emerged as a promising tool for predicting Parkinson's disease based on various features, such as voice analysis, gait analysis, and medical imaging.
# Project Scope:

# Data Collection:
Gathering relevant patient data, including medical history, symptoms, genetic information, and potentially imaging data (e.g., MRI, PET).
# Feature Engineering:
Extracting meaningful features from the collected data, such as voice analysis, gait analysis, or cognitive assessments.
# Model Selection and Training: 
Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Neural Networks) and training them on the prepared data.
# Model Evaluation: 
Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# Ethical Considerations: 
Addressing privacy concerns, ensuring fairness, and avoiding biases in the prediction process.
